        <h2>History of Mumbai</h2>
        <p>In the 3rd century BCE, the islands formed part of the Maurya Empire, during its expansion in the south, ruled by the Buddhist emperor Ashoka of Magadha. <br>The Kanheri Caves in Borivali were excavated from basalt rock in the first century CE, and served as an important centre of Buddhism in Western India during ancient Times. The city then was known as Heptanesia (Ancient Greek: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek geographer Ptolemy in 150 CE. The Mahakali Caves in Andheri were cut out between the 1st century BCE and the 6th century CE.

            Between the 2nd century BCE and 9th century CE, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: Satavahanas, Western Satraps, Abhira, Vakataka, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas, before being ruled by the Shilaharas from 810 to 1260.[78] Some of the oldest edifices in the city built during this period are the Jogeshwari Caves (between 520 and 525), Elephanta Caves (between the sixth to seventh century), Walkeshwar Temple (10th century), and Banganga Tank (12th century).<br>
            
            
            
            <br>Mumbai was originally a group of seven islands, inhabited by fishing communities. It was ruled by the Portuguese before being handed over to the British in 1661 as part of a royal dowry. The British developed it into a major port city, making it a commercial center. Over time, it grew into Indiaâ€™s financial capital, housing institutions like the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and Reserve Bank of India.</p>
